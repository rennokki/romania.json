# romania.json
romania.json is just a bunch of `.json` files that contain data about states, cities and even institutions from Romania. It provides a consistent way of storing it, since there's a lot to search on the internet to find these.

# What's in the box?
* Regions with its own cities. Each city has a corresponding ZIP Code and the map coordinates.
* **[BETA]** Regions with its institutions (schools & high-schools)

# Where's the download button?
The latest (minifed; production-ready) `.json` files are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/rennokki/romania.json/releases) for download.

# I spot a mistake!
If you spot a mistake or simply want to contribute, a PR with the changes is enough. The only thing to stick with is the consistency.

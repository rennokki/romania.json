# romania.json
romania.json is just a bunch of `.json` files that might be helpful if you try to create an app which uses Romania's states or schools.

# Availability
* Regions with its own cities. Each city has a corresponding ZIP Code and the map coordinates.
* **[BETA]** Regions with its institutions (schools & high-schools).

# Contribution
If you spot a mistake or simply want to contribute, a PR is enough. Make sure the JSON is valid (the tests will still run and stop if something si wrong, tho')
